# Data Analysis Project with Menu Dataset

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing nutritional information from a restaurant or fast-food chain menu. The goal is to conduct a comprehensive and professional data analysis. Below are the suggested tasks and exercises for the project.

## 1. Data Cleaning
- **Null Value Check:** Identify and handle missing values.
- **Data Normalization:** Standardize formats, such as serving size units.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Look for unusual or extreme data.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistical Analysis:** Calculate basic statistics for numerical variables.
- **Category Distribution:** Examine the distribution of items across different categories.
- **Correlations:** Investigate relationships between various nutritional variables.

## 3. Data Visualization
- **Histograms and Box Plots:** For nutrient distribution.
- **Bar Charts:** Compare nutrients across different food categories.
- **Heat Maps:** Visualize correlations between nutrients.

## 4. Advanced Analysis
- **Clustering:** Group foods based on nutritional profiles using machine learning techniques.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality and understand main variations.

## 5. Interpretation and Presentation
- **Findings Report:** Summarize interesting patterns or anomalies.
- **Recommendations:** Suggestions based on the analysis.

Each of these tasks will contribute to a deep understanding of the dataset and enable the creation of a solid and professional data analysis portfolio.
